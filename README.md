# MFCC Core

MFCC core implementation in C (fixed point) and SystemVerilog with pipeline architecture.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a complete implementation of an MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) core, widely used in speech recognition and audio processing applications.

* **C Implementation:** Core developed using fixed-point arithmetic for improved performance in embedded systems with limited resources.
* **SystemVerilog Implementation:** IP with pipeline architecture, ideal for FPGA and ASIC synthesis, enabling high performance and parallelism.
